## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Business Goal 

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a Advance  regression model using regularization for the prediction of House price.

- To improve the business in Housing.
- House price data has been used


## Conclusions
Hence the equation:
Log(Y) = 11.996 + 0.120(x1) + 0.116(x2) + 0.049(x3) + 0.048(x4) + 0.037(x5) + 0.030(x6) + 0.019(x7) + 0.015(x8) + 0.009(x9) + 0.008(x10)
+ 0.008(x11) + 0.006(x12) + 0.005(x13) + 0.005(x14) +0.003(x15) - 0.003(x16) - 0.008(x17) - 0.092(x18) + Error term(RSS + alpha * (sum of absolute value of coefficients)

INFERENCE

Suggestions for Surprise Housing is to keep a check on these predictors affecting the price of the house.
The higher values of positive coeeficients suggest a high sale value.

Some of those features are:-

GrLivArea	Above grade (ground) living area square feet
OverallQual	Rates of overall material and finish of the house
OverallCond	Rates of overall condition of the house
TotalBsmtSF	Total square feet of basement area
GarageArea	Size of garage in square feet
The higher values of negative coeeficients suggest a decrease in sale value.

Some of those features are:-

PropAge	Age of the property at the time of seeling
KitchenAbvGr	Identifies the kitchen location in the sale

* When the market value of the property is lower than the Predicted Sale Price, it is the time to buy.
